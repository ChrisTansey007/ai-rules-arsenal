# Email Setup Documentation Standards

**Write email setup documentation that users actually understand - especially those using modern authentication (passkeys).**

---

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Front-Load Context (The "Why")

**Rule:** Start every guide with 1-2 sentences explaining when/why this is needed.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
# Gmail Setup

Step 1: Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
# Gmail Setup

**Use this guide when connecting your Gmail account to the email app.**  
Gmail requires an app-specific password for email apps due to security requirements.

Step 1: Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
```

**Why it matters:** Users need to know if this guide applies to them before investing time reading it.

---

### 2. Number All Steps

**Rule:** Use `1)` `2)` `3)` format - never

 unnumbered bullet lists for procedures.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
- Go to security settings
- Click app passwords
- Generate password
- Copy and paste
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
1. Go to security settings
2. Click "App Passwords"
3. Click "Generate"
4. Copy the 16-character password
5. Paste it in the password field
```

**Why it matters:** Users need to know progress ("I'm on step 3 of 5") and reference specific steps when asking for help.

---

### 3. Distinguish Password Types

**Rule:** Always label password fields with their specific type.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
Enter your password
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
Enter your **app-specific password** (not your regular Yahoo password)
```

**Even Better:**
```markdown
**App-Specific Password** (16 characters, like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop)
_Not your regular password or the one you use on Yahoo's website_
```

**Why it matters:** Users with passkeys don't have "regular passwords" - specificity prevents confusion.

---

### 4. Address Passkeys Explicitly

**Rule:** If provider commonly uses passkeys, mention it upfront.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
Enter your password to continue
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
**Don't have a password?**  
If you sign in to Yahoo with your fingerprint or face (passkey), you'll need to generate an app-specific password for this email app. See instructions below.
```

**Why it matters:** 40%+ of users on modern providers use passkeys. They'll be confused by "enter password" instructions.

---

### 5. Make Links Clickable and Explicit

**Rule:** Use `[descriptive text](url)` with `target="_blank"` where applicable.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
Go to your security settings
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
Go to [Yahoo Account Security](https://account.yahoo.com/security) (opens in new tab)
```

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
Visit: https://account.yahoo.com/security
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
Visit: [account.yahoo.com/security](https://account.yahoo.com/security)
```

**Why it matters:** Users should be able to click directly - reduces copy/paste errors and friction.

---

### 6. Add Troubleshooting Tables

**Rule:** Include "Symptom ‚Üí Cause ‚Üí Fix" tables for common issues.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| "Authentication failed" | Using regular password instead of app password | Generate and use app-specific password from security settings |
| "App passwords" option missing | 2FA not enabled | Enable Two-Factor Authentication first |
| Password not working | Spaces in password | Remove spaces or paste exactly as shown |
```

**Why it matters:** Users need quick solutions, not full debugging guides. Tables are scannable.

---

### 7. Include Time Estimates

**Rule:** Tell users how long things take.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
Test your connection
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
Test your connection (takes 10-15 seconds)
```

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
Complete Gmail setup
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
Complete Gmail setup (5 minutes total)
```

**Why it matters:** Sets expectations and reduces abandonment ("This is taking forever!").

---

### 8. Provide Concrete Examples

**Rule:** Show real examples, not placeholders.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
Enter your email: [your-email@example.com]
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
Enter your email: john.doe@yahoo.com
```

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
The password will look like: ****************
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
The password will look like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop (16 characters with spaces)
```

**Why it matters:** Users pattern-match. Real examples reduce confusion about format.

---

### 9. Use Progressive Disclosure

**Rule:** Provide quick start, then detailed guide. Don't overwhelm.

**Structure:**
```markdown
## Quick Start (2 minutes)
[Essential steps only - no explanation]

## Detailed Guide (5 minutes)
[Full walkthrough with screenshots]

## Advanced Options
[For power users only]
```

**Why it matters:** Power users want speed. Beginners want detail. Serve both.

---

### 10. End with Success Criteria

**Rule:** Tell users how to know they succeeded.

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
Setup complete!
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
## You'll Know It Worked When...

‚úÖ You see "Syncing emails..." in the app  
‚úÖ Your recent emails appear within 30 seconds  
‚úÖ No error messages displayed

**Still seeing errors?** See the Troubleshooting section above.
```

**Why it matters:** Reduces support tickets from users unsure if they succeeded.

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" error

**Possible causes:**
1. **Using wrong password type**  
   Solution: Use the app-specific password (16 chars), not your regular password

2. **Password has spaces**  
   Solution: Remove spaces when pasting (or paste exactly as shown with spaces)

3. **App password expired** (Yahoo, after 6 months inactive)  
   Solution: Generate a new app password

### Can't find "App Passwords" option

**Cause:** Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) not enabled  
**Solution:** Enable 2FA first in your account security settings

### Still not working?

Contact support with:
- Email provider (Yahoo, Gmail, etc.)
- Error message (screenshot helpful)
- Account type (personal vs work)
```

## ‚ôø Accessibility Guidelines

### Screen Readers

**Required:**
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Links have descriptive text (not "click here")
- [ ] Form labels associated with inputs
- [ ] Error messages use `role="alert"`

**Example:**
```html
<label for="app-password">App-Specific Password</label>
<input 
  id="app-password" 
  type="password" 
  aria-describedby="password-help"
/>
<span id="password-help" class="help-text">
  16-character password from your provider's security settings
</span>
```

### Visual Clarity

**Required:**
- [ ] Text contrast ratio >= 4.5:1
- [ ] Font size >= 14px for body text
- [ ] Links underlined or clearly distinguished

---

## üåç Internationalization Considerations

### Language-Neutral Examples

**‚ùå Bad:**
```markdown
Your email will be: john.doe@yahoo.com
```

**‚úÖ Good:**
```markdown
Your email format: yourname@yahoo.com
```

### Universal Concepts

**Avoid region-specific references:**
- ‚ùå "Like your SSN, but for email"
- ‚úÖ "A unique identifier for your account"

### Translatable Structure

**Keep translation in mind:**
```markdown
<!-- Good: Short, self-contained sentences -->
Generate an app password. It takes 2 minutes.

<!-- Bad: Complex sentence structure -->
You'll need to, if you haven't already done so previously, generate what's called an app-specific password by visiting your security settings page.
```

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Assuming Users Have Passwords

**‚ùå Don't assume:**
```markdown
Enter your password
```

**‚úÖ Acknowledge reality:**
```markdown
Enter your app-specific password (or generate one if you use passkeys)
```

### Mistake 2: Using Technical Jargon

**‚ùå Technical:**
```markdown
Configure your MUA to authenticate via SMTP AUTH using STARTTLS on port 587
```

**‚úÖ Plain language:**
```markdown
Set up your email app to send mail securely through Yahoo's servers
```

### Mistake 3: Vague Error Messages

**‚ùå Vague:**
```markdown
Something went wrong. Try again.
```

**‚úÖ Specific:**
```markdown
Connection failed: Check your password
- Using app-specific password? (not regular password)
- Remove any spaces when pasting
- [Generate new password ‚Üí]
```

### Mistake 4: No Visual Aids

**‚ùå Text only:**
```markdown
Click the gear icon, then settings, then security, then app passwords
```

**‚úÖ With visual:**
```markdown
1. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon (top right)
2. Select "Settings"
3. Go to "Security" tab
4. Find "App Passwords" section

[Screenshot showing the security page with App Passwords highlighted]
```

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Mobile Users

**‚ùå Desktop-only:**
```markdown
Right-click and select "Copy"
```

**‚úÖ Cross-platform:**
```markdown
Copy the password (long-press on mobile, right-click on desktop)
```

---

## üì± Mobile-Specific Considerations

### Touch Targets

**Minimum size:** 48x48px for interactive elements

```css
/* Ensure buttons are tappable */
.copy-button {
  min-width: 48px;
  min-height: 48px;
  padding: 12px 24px;
}
```

### Keyboard Behavior

```html
<!-- Auto-focus on mobile -->
<input 
  type="email" 
  inputmode="email"
  autocomplete="email"
/>

<!-- Numeric for verification codes -->
<input 
  type="text" 
  inputmode="numeric" 
  pattern="[0-9]*"
/>
```

### Responsive Images

```markdown
